=head1 NAME

MVC::Neaf::Route::Null - route stub for Not Even A Framework

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a utility class.
Nothing to see here unless one intends to work on L<MVC::Neaf> itself.

A Null route will be substituted in L<MVC::Neaf::Request>'s methods until
real routing has been performed.

Normally this shouldn't even be instantiated as L<MVC::Neaf::Route::PreRoute>
will take over before any user code gets a chance to be executed by Neaf.

But for the sake of completeness, it is here.

    croak "No form '$name' in null route";
};

};
