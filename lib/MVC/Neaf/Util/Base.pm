use Carp;

Will happily accept any args and pack them into self.

sub new {
    my ($class, %opt) = @_;

    return bless \%opt, $class;
};

Like croak() from Carp, but the message is prefixed
with self's package and the name of method
in which error occurred.

=cut

sub my_croak {
    my ($self, $msg) = @_;

    my $sub = [caller(1)]->[3];
    $sub =~ s/.*:://;

    croak join "", (ref $self || $self),"->",$sub,": ",$msg;
};
