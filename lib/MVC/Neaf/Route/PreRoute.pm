=head1 NAME

MVC::Neaf::Route::PreRoute - temporary route stub for Not Even A Framework

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is utility class.
Nothing to see here unless one intends to work on L<MVC::Neaf> itself.

It will show up in C<$req-E<gt>route> while a specific route
has not yet been selected.

It can still contain hooks & helpers, that's what it's for.
