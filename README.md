# NAME

MVC::Neaf `[ni:f]` stands for **Not Even A Framework**.

# OVERVIEW

The following code can be run as a PSGI application or CGI script:

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use MVC::Neaf;

    get + post "/" => sub {
		my $req = shift;

		return {
            -view     => 'TT',
			-template => \'Hello, [% name %]!',
			-type     => 'text/plain',
			name      => $req->param( name => qr/\w+/, "Stranger" ),
		};
    };

    neaf->run;

Just like many other frameworks, Neaf organises an application
into a *prefix tree* of routes. Each *route* has a *handler* `sub`
which receives one and only argument - a *request* object.

The *request* contains *everything* the application needs to know
about the outside world.

The *handler* must either *return* a hash for rendering, or *die*.
A 3-digit exception is a valid way of returning a configurable error page.

The *return hash* may contain dash-prefixed keys to control Neaf itself.
For instance, the default view is JSON-based but adding 

    -view => 'TT', -template => 'my.tpl'

to the hash would result in using `Template::Toolkit` instead.

# NOTABLE FEATURES

* **Mandatory validation** - parameters and cookies are always regex-checked.

* **Forms** that validate a bunch of input parameters, additionally
producing hashes of errors and raw values for resubmission.

* **Path-based defaults** that can be overridden in route definition or
by controller itself:

    neaf default => { -view => 'JS', version => $VERSION }, path => '/api';

* **Hooks** that may be executed at different stages:

    neaf pre_logic => sub {
        my $req = shift;
        die 403 unless $req->session->{is_admin};
    }, path => '/admin';

* **Easy CLI debugging** - see `perl myapp.pl --help`

See [examples](example/) for more.
